## Issues While Completing Assignment
I was having issues with my input part of my from disappearing after pressing the submit button. So the user would have to refresh the page if they wanted to run another query. We figured out I had the incorrect end tag in the html which fixed this issue.

Another issue I am running into is my items are saying "undefined" on the website link after users put in a location.  I found a fix on the Stack Overflow link below.
