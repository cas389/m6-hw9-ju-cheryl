Assignment 9 - Weather Widget for MMC6278 class

## Issues While Completing Assignment
I was having issues with my input part of my from disappearing after pressing the submit button. So the user would have to refresh the page if they wanted to run another query. We figured out I had the incorrect end tag in the html which fixed this issue.

Another issue I am running into is my items are saying "undefined" on the website link after users put in a location.  I found a fix on the Stack Overflow link below.

The last issue I ran into was displaying the icon for the weather. I finally came up with how to render the photos by using an if/ else if statement. I know this is probably not the correct way to do this, but at least I was able to get it working correctly.
